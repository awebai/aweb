Extract project_id from auth\n2. Pre-check workspace immutability (project_id + alias match)\n3. Resolve/create repo record (normalize git origin)\n4. Upsert workspace record in SQL (immutability constraints, alias collision check via DB + Redis)\n5. Update presence in Redis (best-effort) — hash + secondary indexes\n6. Cloud-only: track usage (non-blocking)\n7. Return OK\n\nPhilosophy: presence is a cache of SQL. SQL authoritative, Redis ephemeral.\n\nNote: only restore the beadhub-specific heartbeat.
